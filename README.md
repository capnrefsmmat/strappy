strappy
=======

strappy is a teaching language (in the vein of the *How to Design Programs*
[teaching languages](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/htdp-langs.html)) for
Racket, providing an environment for learning introductory statistics through
resampling and permutation.

Introductory statistics is typically taught by working through a laundry list of
basic tests: *t* tests, chi-squared tests, one-way ANOVA, and so on. This gives
the students no intuition into statistics, and tends to leave them with
misconceptions about the nature of statistics that have
[negative side effects later](http://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/). Students
spend more of their time memorizing formulas than understanding the basic
principles of statistics.

strappy provides an environment to learn the opposite way: bootstrapping and
permutation are the core concepts. Students learn exactly what it means to
sample from a null distribution by constructing null distributions in code
themselves, and can explore different test statistics and distributions easily.

Some examples will appear here when strappy has stabilized.
